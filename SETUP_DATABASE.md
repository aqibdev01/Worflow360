# Database Setup Guide - CRITICAL

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Your Database Is Not Set Up Yet!

The authentication isn't working because **the database tables don't exist yet**. You need to run the SQL migrations in your Supabase project.

---

## Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Open Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to [https://supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Select your project: **dyihhrjyyynwufpwggjn**

### Step 2: Run the SQL Migration

1. In the Supabase Dashboard, click **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
2. Click **New Query**
3. Copy and paste the entire contents of this file:
   ```
   /Users/fakhirhassan/Desktop/workflow360/supabase/migrations/20250126_initial_schema.sql
   ```

### Step 3: Execute the Migration

1. Click **Run** (or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)
2. Wait for the green success message
3. You should see: "Success. No rows returned"

### Step 4: Verify Tables Were Created

1. Click **Table Editor** in the left sidebar
2. You should now see these tables:
   - ✅ users
   - ✅ organizations
   - ✅ organization_members
   - ✅ projects
   - ✅ project_members
   - ✅ tasks
   - ✅ sprints

### Step 5: Configure Authentication Settings

1. Click **Authentication** → **Providers** in the left sidebar
2. Click on **Email** provider
3. **DISABLE** "Confirm email" (for development)
4. Click **Save**

## After Setup: Test Authentication

### Test Signup:

1. Go to http://localhost:3001/auth/signup
2. Sign up with a **new email** (one you haven't tried before)
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. Look for these logs:
   ```
   🔐 Attempting sign up for: your-email@example.com
   ✅ Auth user created: [user-id]
   📧 Email confirmation required: false
   👤 Getting or creating user profile for: [user-id]
   📝 Creating new user profile
   ✅ User profile created successfully
   ```

### Test Login:

1. Go to http://localhost:3001/auth/login
2. Login with the email/password you just created
3. Check console for:
   ```
   🔐 Attempting sign in for: your-email@example.com
   ✅ Sign in successful: [user-id]
   📧 Email confirmed: true
   ```

4. You should be redirected to `/dashboard`

## If You Still Have Issues

### Issue: "relation public.users does not exist"

**Solution:** The migration didn't run. Go back to Step 2 and run the SQL migration.

### Issue: "Email confirmation required: true"

**Solution:** Disable email confirmation in Step 5.

### Issue: "new row violates row-level security policy"

**Solution:** The migration file includes RLS policies. Make sure you ran the ENTIRE migration file, not just part of it.

### Issue: "Invalid credentials" after signup

**Causes:**
1. Email confirmation is still enabled - Disable it in Authentication settings
2. You're trying to login with an old email that was created when confirmation was enabled
3. Wrong password

**Solution:**
1. Disable email confirmation (Step 5)
2. Sign up with a NEW email address
3. Then try logging in

## Detailed Migration File Location

The SQL migration file is located at:
```
/Users/fakhirhassan/Desktop/workflow360/supabase/migrations/20250126_initial_schema.sql
```

This file creates:
- All database tables
- Indexes for performance
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Enums for status types
- Triggers for updated_at timestamps

---

## Quick Copy: Open SQL File

Run this command to view the SQL migration:

```bash
cat /Users/fakhirhassan/Desktop/workflow360/supabase/migrations/20250126_initial_schema.sql
```

Then copy the entire output and paste it into Supabase SQL Editor.

---

## Alternative: Use Supabase CLI (Advanced)

If you have Supabase CLI installed:

```bash
cd /Users/fakhirhassan/Desktop/workflow360
supabase db push
```

But for now, the manual approach above is faster and more reliable.
